#Project Reflection Report
Project Name: Bootstrap Agency Website

#Project Planning
I first understood the project requirement, which was to build a responsive multi-page website using Bootstrap. I planned to create three main pages:
Home (index.html)
About (about.html)
Contact (contact.html)
I decided to maintain consistent navigation and styling across all pages.

#Setting Up the Folder Structure
I created a project folder with:
index.html
about.html
contact.html
This helped keep the project organized and professional.

#Designing the Home Page
Added Bootstrap CDN link
Created a responsive navbar
Added a hero section
Added services/cards section
Ensured proper spacing using Bootstrap classes
I tested responsiveness using browser developer tools.

#Creating About Page
Maintained the same navbar for consistency
Added image section
Added company description
Used Bootstrap grid system for alignment
I initially faced an issue where the image was not displaying, which I later fixed by correcting the image path.

#Creating Contact Page
Designed a contact form using Bootstrap form classes
Added input fields (Name, Email, Message)
Styled the button properly
Ensured clean spacing and alignment

#Initialized Git in the project folder
Added files using git add .
Committed changes using git commit
Connected local repository to GitHub
Pushed code successfully

#Tools & Resources Used
I used the following tools and resources:
Bootstrap documentation (for layout and components)
Git & GitHub for version control and deployment

Initially unsure how to deploy the project.
Solution: Enabled GitHub Pages and selected correct branch.
